        "# Building an Intelligent SQL Query Assistant with LangChain and Groq\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This notebook shows how to create an intelligent SQL query assistant using LangChain, Groq LLM, and SQLite. The system is designed to convert natural language questions into SQL queries and provide detailed explanations of the results, making database interactions more accessible to non-technical users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal\n",
        "The primary objectives of this notebook are:\n",
        "1. Set up a database environment by converting CSV data (salary information) into a SQLite database\n",
        "2. Create an intelligent SQL agent using LangChain that can:\n",
        "   - Interpret natural language questions about employee salary data\n",
        "   - Generate appropriate SQL queries automatically\n",
        "   - Execute queries against the database\n",
        "   - Provide human-readable explanations of the results\n",
        "3. Demonstrate the agent's capabilities by analyzing employee compensation data, including metrics like base salary and longevity pay across different grade levels\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Components\n",
        "- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications\n",
        "- **Groq**: Large Language Model provider (using llama-3.3-70b-versatile model)\n",
        "- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing and querying salary data\n",
        "- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV handling\n",
        "- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook showcases a practical implementation of natural language to SQL conversion, making database querying more accessible while maintaining the ability to perform complex analytical tasks on employee compensation data."
