        "\n",
        "This notebook implements an automated social media monitoring system using CrewAI, a framework that enables the creation of autonomous AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks. The system is designed to provide comprehensive brand analysis and social media monitoring through a coordinated team of specialized AI agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## System Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The system utilizes four specialized AI agents:\n",
        "- **Researcher**: Gathers comprehensive information about the target brand\n",
        "- **Social Media Monitor**: Tracks brand mentions across platforms\n",
        "- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Evaluates the emotional tone of brand mentions\n",
        "- **Report Generator**: Synthesizes findings into actionable reports\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
